                        shall be binding upon PartMiner Industries, LLC (the “Seller”) unless accepted by it in writing . All terms and conditions c o n t a i

                        they would materially alter this document, and Seller hereby objects thereto. All prior proposals, negotiations
                        and representations, if any, are merged herein. Buyer will be deemed to have assented to all terms and conditions
                        contained herein if any part of the goods and/or services described herein are shipped or an invoice is presented in
                        connection with the said goods and/or services. <br/> <br/>
                        TERMS: Buyer agrees to pay for the products according to the Seller's payment terms. In the event Buyer fails to make
                        any payment to Seller when due, Buyer's entire account(s) with Seller shall become immediately due and payable
                        without notice or demand. All past due amounts shall bear interest at a rate of 1.5% per month or 18% per year. The prices
                        for the Products shall be provided for in Seller’s invoices and statements of accounts.
                        RESERVE OF RIGHT OF OWNERSHIP — All merchandise, whether present and future, sold by the Seller to the Buyer
                        shall remain the sole property of the Seller until all sums due to the Seller whether invoiced or not have been fully paid,
                        the whole including interests and costs. <br/> <br/>
                        <b>PURCHASE MONEY SECURITY AGREEMENT</b> — As continuing collateral security for the payment of all present and
                        future indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of the Buyer owed to the Seller, including interests thereon and all costs of
                        enforcement of this security agreement, the Buyer hereby grants a Purchase Money Security Interest Agreement in all
                        present and future inventory, goods and Products supplied by the Seller to the Buyer, together with all proceeds
                        therefrom. The Buyer acknowledges that value has been given and that the parties have not agreed to postpone the
                        time for attachment of the security interest hereby granted. <br/> <br/>
                        <b>REMEDIES OF SELLER:</b> Upon default by Buyer, Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller all attorney fees and court costs
                        incurred by Seller in connection therewith. Buyer agrees that any of the following shall constitute an event of default which
                        shall enable Seller, at its option, to cancel any unexecuted portion of this order or to exercise any right or remedy which it
                        may have by law: (a) the failure of Buyer to perform any term or condition contained herein; (b) any failure of Buyer to give
                        required notice; (c) the insolvency of Buyer or its failure to pay debts as they mature, an assignment by Buyer for benefit of
                        its creditors, the appointment of receiver for Buyer or for the materials covered by this order or the filing of any petition
                        to adjudicate Buyer bankrupt; (d) the death, incompetence, dissolution or termination of existence of Buyer; (e) a failure
                        by Buyer to provide adequate assurance of performance within ten (10) days after a justified demand by Seller or (f)
                        if Seller, in good faith, believes that Buyer's prospect of performance under this Agreement is impaired. All rights and
                        remedies of Seller herein are in addition to, and shall not exclude, any rights or remedies that Seller may have by law. In
                        the event of a default on the part of the Buyer, the Buyer hereby accepts to pay all reasonable legal or collection fees,
                        including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Seller in order to recover all sums owing to the Seller in accordance
                        herewith. To that end, the Buyer hereby acknowledges and recognizes that attorney fees equivalent to twenty-four percent
                        (24%) of the value of any claim by the Seller shall constitute reasonable attorney fees to be paid by the Buyer to the Seller in
                        addition to any other amounts owing to the Seller. <br/> <br/>
                        <b>GOVERNING LAW:</b> This Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance
                        with the laws of the State of NH, USA. Furthermore, the parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive
                        jurisdiction of a court in the County of Merrimack, NH, USA with respect to any claims or any disputes arising from
                        any rights or obligations provided for in this Agreement or otherwise which may result in any way from the
                        parties’ business relationship. <br/> <br/>
                        <b>DELIVERY:</b> Seller will make a good faith effort to complete delivery of the products as indicated by Seller in writing,
                        but Seller assumes no responsibility or liability and will accept no back charge for loss or damage due to delay or inability
                        to deliver, whether or not such loss or damage was made known to Seller, including, but not limited to, liability for Seller's
                        non-performance caused by acts of God, war, labor difficulties, accidents, inability to obtain materials, delays of carriers,
                        contractors or suppliers or any other causes of any kind whatever beyond the control of Seller. Under no circumstances
                        shall Seller be liable for any special, consequential, incidental, indirect, or liquidated damages, losses, or expense (whether
                        or not based on negligence) arising directly or indirectly from delays or failure to give notice of delay.
                        <b>WARRANTY:</b> THE BUYER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE WARRANTY, IF ANY, IS THAT PROVIDED BY THE
                        PRODUCT'S MANUFACTURER. SELLER MAKES NO EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. SELLER HEREBY
                        DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, WHETHER IMPLIED BY OPERATION OF LAW OR
                        OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
                        AND FITNESS OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IN NO EVENT,
                        WILL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ANY OTHER LOSS,
                        DAMAGE, COST OF REPAIRS OR INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR LIQUIDATED
                        DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE
                        OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, SALE,
                        TRANSPORTATION, INSTALLATION, USE OR REPAIR OF THE PRODUCTS SOLD BY SELLER. BUYER
                        HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IN NO EVENT,
                        SHALL SELLER'S LIABILITY, IF ANY, EXCEED THE NET SALES PRICE OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT(S); NO
                        ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE SHALL BE MADE FOR THE LABOR OR EXPENSE OF REPAIRING OR
                        REPLACING DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS OR 
                        WORKMANSHIP OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE SAME. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
                        PARAGRAPH, ALL PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY SELLER AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS
                        ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," "WHERE IS," AND "WITH ALL FAULTS."
                        RECOMMENDATIONS BY SELLER: Buyer acknowledges that Seller does not make and specifically negates, renounces
                        and disclaims any representations, warranties and/or guaranties of any kind or character, expressed or implied, with
                        respect to (i) the products sold, their use, design, application or operation, their merchantability, their physical condition
                        or their fitness for a particular purpose, (ii) the maintenance or other expenses to be incurred in connection with the
                        products, (iii) the engineering, design, fabrication work or any other work or service (whether gratuitous or for payment)
                        supplied by Seller and/or its agents, suppliers and employees or (iv) the accuracy or reliability of any information, designs
                        or documents furnished to Buyer. Seller neither assumes, nor authorizes any person to assume for it, any other obligation
                        in connection with the sale of its products and/or rendering of its services. Any recommendations made by Seller
                        concerning the use, design, application or operation of the products shall not be construed as representations or
                        warranties, expressed or implied. Failure by Seller to make recommendations or give advice to Buyer shall not impose any
                        liability upon Seller. <br/> <br/>
                        <b>INDEMNIFICATION:</b> The Buyer shall at its own expense apply for and obtain any permits and inspections required
                        for the installation and/or use of the products. Seller makes no promise or representation that the products or
                        services will conform to any federal, state or local laws ordinances, regulations, codes or standards, except as particularly
                        specified and agreed upon in writing by an authorized representative of Seller. The Seller's products are not for use in or
                        with any nuclear facility unless specifically so stated by Seller in writing. <br/> <br/>
                        Seller shall not be responsible for any losses or damages sustained by the Buyer or any other person as a result of
                        improper installation or misapplication of the products. Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
                        agents and employees against any loss, damage, claim, suit, liability, judgment or expense (including, without limitation,
                        attorney's fees) arising out of or in connection with any injury, disease or death of persons (including, without limitation,
                        Buyer's employees and agents) or damage to or loss of any property or the environment, or violation of any
                        applicable laws or regulations resulting from or in connection with the sale, transportation, installation, use, or repair
                        of the products by Buyer or of the information, designs, services or other work supplied to Buyer, whether caused by the
                        concurrent and/or contributory negligence of Buyer, Seller, or any of their agents, employees or suppliers. The obligations,
                        indemnities and covenants contained in this paragraph shall survive the consummation or termination of this transaction.
                        INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE: Claims for damage, shortage or errors in shipping must be reported within fifteen
                        (15) days following delivery to Buyer. Buyer shall have fifteen (15) days from the date Buyer receives any products to
                        inspect such products and services for defects and nonconformance which are not due to damage, shortage or errors
                        in shipping and notify Seller, in writing, of any defects, nonconformance or rejection of such products. After such fifteen
                        (15) day period, Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the products, if not previously accepted. After
                        such acceptance, Buyer shall have no right to reject the products for any reason or to revoke acceptance. Buyer hereby
                        agrees that such fifteen (15) day period is a reasonable amount of time for such inspection and revocation. Buyer shall
                        have no right to order any change or modification to any product or services previously ordered by Buyer or its
                        representatives or cancel any order without Seller's written consent and payment to Seller of all charges, expenses,
                        commissions and reasonable profits owed to or incurred by Seller. Specially fabricated or ordered items may not be
                        canceled or returned, and no refund will be made. The sole and exclusive remedy for merchandise alleged to be
                        defective in workmanship or material will be the replacement of the merchandise subject to the manufacturer's inspection
                        and warranty. <br/> <br/>
                        <b>RETURNS:</b> Buyer may return any product which Seller stocks with no restocking charge if: (i) it is in new condition,
                        suitable for resale in its undamaged original packaging and with all its original parts and (ii) it has not
                        been used, installed, modified, rebuilt, reconditioned, repaired, altered or damaged and (iii) meets all Local, State and
                        Federal laws governing the type of product that can be sold or put into transit in the State in which the product is
                        being returned. Buyer's surplus job returns, and those not meeting (i), (ii) and (iii), above, will be evaluated on an
                        individual basis after Buyer has contacted Seller's authorized representative for prior written permission. Special orders
                        or non-stock items may be returned if the manufacturer will accept the return. Except for items Seller stocks which meet
                        (i), (ii) and (iii), above, credit memoranda issued for authorized returns shall be subject to the following deductions: (a) cost
                        of putting items in salable condition; (b) transportation charges, if not prepaid; and (c) handling and restocking charges.
                        SHIPMENTS: All products are shipped F.O.B., point of shipment. Risk of loss shall transfer to the Buyer upon tender
                        of goods to Buyer, Buyer's representative, or common carrier. The cost of any special packing or special handling caused
                        by Buyer's requirements or requests shall be added to the amount of the order. If Buyer causes or requests a shipment
                        delay, or if Seller ships or delivers the products erroneously as a result of inaccurate, incomplete or misleading
                        information supplied by Buyer or its agents or employees, storage and all other additional costs and risks shall be
                        borne solely by Buyer. Claims for products damaged or lost in transit should be made by Buyer to the carrier, as Seller's
                        responsibility ceases upon tender of goods to Buyer, Buyer's representative or common carrier.
                        TAXES: The amount of any sales, excise or other taxes, if any, applicable to the products shall be added to the purchase
                        price and shall be paid by Buyer unless Buyer provides Seller with an exemption certificate acceptable to the taxing
                        authorities. Any taxes which Seller may be required to pay or collect under any existing or future law, upon or with respect
                        to the sale, purchase, delivery, storage, processing, use or consumption of any of the products, including taxes upon
                        or measured by the receipts from the sale thereof, shall be for the account of the Buyer, who shall promptly pay the
                        amount thereof to Seller upon demand.  <br/> <br/>
                        <b>SEVERABILITY:</b> These terms and conditions of sale shall not be construed against the party preparing them, but shall be
                        construed as if all parties jointly prepared these terms and conditions of sale and any uncertainty or ambiguity shall
                        not be interpreted against any one party. If any provision hereof is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any
                        present or future laws, such provision shall be fully severable and the terms and conditions herein shall be construed
                        and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never been made a part hereof. The remaining
                        provisions herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
                        provisions or by their severance herefrom.
                        SET-OFF: Buyer shall not be entitled to set-off any amounts due Buyer against any amount due Seller in connection
                        with this transaction. <br/> <br/>
                        <b>CERTIFICATIONS:</b> Seller certifies that it does not and will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated
                        facilities at any of its establishments and that it does not permit and will not permit its employees to perform their services
                        at any location, under its control, where segregated facilities are maintained. Seller certifies further that its services are
                        performed in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.
                        NON-WAIVER: Seller's failure to insist upon the strict performance of any term or condition herein shall not be deemed
                        a waiver of any of Seller's rights or remedies hereunder, nor of its right to insist upon the strict performance of the
                        same or any other term herein in the future. No waiver of any term or condition hereunder shall be valid unless in writing
                        and signed by Seller's Branch Manager. <br/> <br/>
                        <b>ENTIRE AGREEMENT:</b> This document constitutes the entire, complete, and exclusive agreement between the parties
                        with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains all the agreements and conditions of sale; no course of dealing
                        or usage of the trade shall be applicable unless expressly incorporated herein. The terms and conditions contained herein
                        may not be added to, modified, superseded or otherwise altered except by a written modification signed by the Seller's
                        Branch Manager. All transactions shall be governed solely by the terms and conditions contained herein.
                        FORCE MAJEURE – If PartMiner Industries, LLC is delayed or hindered in the performance of any act including the supply or
                        delivery of any products, parts, materials or equipment ordered by reason of any superior force such as weather, acts of nature,
                        pandemic, strike, inability to procure materials, failure of power, restrictive governmental laws or regulations, riots, insurrection,
                        war or other reason of a nature beyond the control of PartMiner Industries, LLC, then PartMiner Industries, LLC shall be
                        excused from any such timely performance and shall only be required to perform when the Force Majeure event no longer
                        impedes such performance. Under all circumstances, however, and notwithstanding any event of Force Majeure, the Buyer
                        shall continue to be obligated to make payment to PartMiner Industries, LLC for Products received in accordance with the
                        agreed upon payment terms.
